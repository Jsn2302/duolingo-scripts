# Duolingo User Scripts

## [Back to back practice](https://github.com/eedrah/duolingo-scripts/raw/master/back-to-back-practice.user.js)
Enables 'continuous' general practice on Duolingo - as soon as one practice session ends another begins. The progress bar is also hidden to simulate continuity.

To disable at the start of the practice (so you can enter timed practice) or the end (so you can review the lesson), hold `shift` when starting or finishing. Keep holding `shift` when reviewing the lesson. Letting go of shift and clicking a button will continue the back-to-back mode.

### Installation
This requires either Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey. Then [click here](https://github.com/eedrah/duolingo-scripts/raw/master/back-to-back-practice.user.js).

### Known issues
When I created this I made it on an English interface, and after I had already bought timed practice. If either of these is not the case for you it may require minor tweaking to the code. I'm happy to accept a pull request or liase with you to upgrade this script.
