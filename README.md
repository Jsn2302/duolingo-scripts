# Duolingo User Scripts

## [Back to back practice](https://github.com/eedrah/duolingo-scripts/raw/master/back-to-back-practice.user.js)
Enables 'continuous' general practice on Duolingo - as soon as one practice session ends another begins. The progress bar is also hidden to simulate continuity. The setting can be disabled by toggling the option in the top-left corner while practicing.

### Installation
This requires either Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey. Then [click here](https://github.com/eedrah/duolingo-scripts/raw/master/back-to-back-practice.user.js).

### Known issues
When I created this I made it on an English interface, and after I had already bought timed practice. If either of these is not the case for you it may require minor tweaking to the code. I'm happy to accept a pull request or liase with you to upgrade this script.
